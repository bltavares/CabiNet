#CabiNet
### A persistent data framework

The CabiNet is a framework for persit data on MySql database written in C#


It's been written in the spare time on my classes. I'm at school, so the development environment has some constraints:

* Controlled environment.
  > Can't install any program, or remove, or wathever

* No internet

* Cant choose the db or any other tool
  >I must use MySQL with the ODBC. Can't use SqlServer or EF...

* Only on spare time.
  > Must code only after doing the activity given by the teacher

You may follow the development on the [blog](http://blog.bltavares.com/tagged/cabinet)
